# Apiary Explorer

![Screenshot of Apiary](.github/screenshot.png)

The goal of Apiary Explorer is to provide a way for users to discover, explore, and more effectively participate in Aragon organizations.

It is an evolution of the now defunct daolist.io and site developed and maintained by [@onbjerg](https://github.com/onbjerg) and the Apiary curation market proposal described [here](https://github.com/1hive/apiary-paper) that has since been partially implemented as Aragon Fundraising. The project has been adopted under the 1Hive umbrella to continue our goal of helping open source communities thrive by making it easier for patrons to support promising open source projects and open source projects to attract and reward contributors.

Apiary is designed to be user-centric rather than organization centric, enabling users to explore and participate in many organizations. Emphasis is placed on curation and discovery. Organizations can be sorted and filter based on usage statistics (which apps are installed, activity level, amount of funding, or user profiles). We also plan to offer a user curated tagging system.

## Design

There are four components in Apiary:

### [taskmaster](/taskmaster)

![Taskmaster Build Status](https://github.com/1Hive/apiary/workflows/Taskmaster%20CI/badge.svg)

The taskmaster schedules tasks for a range of Ethereum blocks onto a queue.

Tasks might be dependent on other tasks, forming a hierarchical block processing pipeline.

Tasks are then processed by one or more workers.

| `START_BLOCK`        | The block to start working from.                                                                 | `6592900`                     |
| `TARGET_BLOCK`       | The block to stop working after. If you specify `latest`, the worker will run indefinitely.      | `latest`                      |
| **Cache / Queue**    |                                                                                                  |                               |
| `REDIS_URL`          | **Required**. The URL of the Redis instance to connect to                                        | `redis://localhost:6379`      |

| `DELAY`              | A delay in milliseconds between scheduling tasks for a block. This is useful if the taskmaster is scheduling blocks faster than the workers can process them, as that might make Redis run out of memory. | None (no delay)                        |

### [worker](/worker)

![Worker Build Status](https://github.com/1Hive/apiary/workflows/Worker%20CI/badge.svg)

The worker pulls tasks from a queue and transforms blocks, logs, transactions and traces in to explorable data.

This pattern is built around the concept that Ethereum is basically one huge event sourcing mechanism, and that Apiary is just a read model.

#### Logging

The worker outputs logs in JSONL format. To make the logs readable you can run the worker like this:

```sh
npm start | npx pino-pretty-min
```

If you're running Apiary using Docker Compose, you can do the same thing by running:

```sh
docker logs -f (docker-compose ps -q worker) | npx pino-pretty-min
```
